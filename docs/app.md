## 1. Routing

All routes are defined in `src/App.jsx`. Pages are lazy-loaded via `React.lazy` + `Suspense`.

| Path | Component | Role Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/login` | Login | None | |
| `/` | AuthRedirect | Any | Redirects to role home |
| `/admin` | AdminDashboard | admin | |
| `/admin/teachers` | AdminTeachers | admin | |
| `/admin/students` | AdminStudents | admin | |
| `/admin/sections` | AdminSections | admin | |
| `/admin/subjects` | AdminSubjects | admin | |
| `/admin/databank` | AdminDataBank | admin | |
| `/admin/users/passwords` | AdminUserPasswords | admin | |
| `/admin/settings` | AdminSettings | admin | |
| `/teacher` | TeacherDashboard | teacher | |
| `/teacher/sections` | TeacherSectionProgress | teacher | Assigned sections only |
| `/teacher/databank` | AdminDataBank (shared) | teacher | Full question access |
| `/teacher/stats` | AdminDashboard (shared) | teacher | Read-only stats view |
| `/teacher/attempt/review/:attemptId` | TeacherAttemptReview | teacher | Full question review for a student's attempt |
| `/teachers/view` | AdminTeachers (isReadOnly) | teacher only | RequireTeacher guard |
| `/students/view` | AdminStudents (isReadOnly) | teacher only | RequireTeacher guard |
| `/sections/view` | AdminSections (isReadOnly) | teacher only | RequireTeacher guard |
| `/subjects/view` | AdminSubjects (isReadOnly) | teacher only | RequireTeacher guard |
| `/student` | StudentDashboard | student | |
| `/student/exam` | ExamLanding | student | |
| `/student/exam/room` | ExamRoom | student | |
| `/student/exam/review/:attemptId` | ExamReview | student | |
| `/report/:token` | SharedReport | None | Public, no auth required |
| `*` | Redirect to `/` | Any | |

## 2. Auth Guards

### RequireAuth
Every standard protected route is wrapped in `<RequireAuth role="...">`.

Checks in order:
1. If loading → show LoadingScreen
2. If no user or no profile → redirect to `/login`
3. If `profile.is_active === false` → show "Account Disabled" screen
4. If role mismatch → redirect to `/${profile.role}` (correct home)
5. If `profile.must_change_password === true` → show PasswordChangeModal (required, cannot dismiss)
6. Otherwise → render children

### RequireTeacher
Used exclusively for the `/*/view` read-only routes. Enforces teacher role and automatically injects `isReadOnly={true}` into the wrapped component via `React.cloneElement`.

- Non-teacher hitting these routes → redirected to their role home
- Inactive accounts → redirected to `/login`
- Force password change → shows PasswordChangeModal before access

The `/report/:token` route is outside all guards — fully public.

---

## 3. AuthContext (`src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx`)

Global auth state provider. Wraps entire app.

State:
- `user` — Supabase auth user object
- `profile` — row from `user_profiles` table
- `loading` — boolean, true during initial session check

Methods:
- `signIn(email, password)` — calls Supabase auth, triggers profile load
- `signOut()` — clears session
- `refreshProfile()` — re-fetches profile from DB
- `completePasswordChange(newPassword)` — updates auth password + sets `must_change_password=false` + patches in-memory profile + navigates to role home

- Each student row: expandable attempts table + "Password" button (if user_id exists)
- Each attempt row has two action buttons:
  - **Review** (FileText icon) — navigates to `/teacher/attempt/review/:attemptId`
  - **Share** (Share2 icon) — opens inline ShareModal to generate a password-protected public link
- ShareModal: generates token + password, inserts into `shared_reports`, shows copyable URL and password
- Password change modal: teacher scope enforced server-side (own sections only)

### Teacher Attempt Review (`src/pages/teacher/AttemptReview.jsx`)
- Route: `/teacher/attempt/review/:attemptId`
- Loads attempt (with student name + reg number) and all snapshots
- Shows student name, reg number, date in header alongside score and grade

- Back button navigates to `/teacher/sections`
- No `show_results_to_students` gate — teachers always have access

### Teacher Read-Only Views
All four pages reuse admin components with `isReadOnly={true}` injected by `RequireTeacher`:
- `/teachers/view` — all teachers (read-only)
- `/students/view` — all students (read-only)
- `/sections/view` — all sections (read-only)
- `/subjects/view` — all subjects (read-only)

RLS grants teachers SELECT on all records in these tables (via `teacher_readonly_rls.sql`).

### Student Dashboard (`src/pages/student/Dashboard.jsx`)

## 8. Utilities (`src/utils/`)

### formatters.js
Display formatting + sorting utilities:
- `formatTimer`, `formatDuration`, `formatScore`, `formatDate`, `formatDateTime`, `formatRelative`, `truncate`, `capitalize`, `formatNumber`
- `parseRegNumber(reg)` — parses IUB reg number into sortable components
- `compareRegNumbers(a, b)` — comparator for student reg number sort
- `parseSectionName(name)` — parses IUB section name into sortable components
- `compareSectionNames(a, b)` — comparator for section name sort

### IUB Reg Number Sort Logic (`compareRegNumbers`)
Pattern: `[S|F][YY][Campus][Dept][Program][Shift][Prefix][Serial]`
Example: `S23BARIN1M01037`

Sort priority (ascending):
1. Year (2-digit, e.g. 23 = 2023)
2. Semester: Spring (S=0) before Fall (F=1)
3. Program number: 1 (BS Morning) → 2 (BS Evening) → 7 (ADP)
4. Shift: Morning (M=0) before Evening (E=1)
5. Serial (last 3 digits)

### IUB Section Name Sort Logic (`compareSectionNames`)
Pattern: `BSARIN-[N]TH-[Num][Shift]`
Example: `BSARIN-7TH-1M`

Sort priority (ascending):
1. Semester number (7TH < 8TH < 9TH)
2. Section number (1 < 2 < 3)
3. Shift: Morning (M=0) before Evening (E=1)

Applied in: `Sections.jsx`, `Students.jsx` (dropdown), `SectionProgress.jsx` (tabs + default selection), `teacher/Dashboard.jsx` (sections overview), `admin/Dashboard.jsx` (teacher stats).

### validators.js
- `validateEmail`, `validatePassword`, `required`, `validateRange`, `validateRegNumber`
- `validateTeacherForm`, `validateStudentForm`, `validateSubjectForm`

### constants.js
